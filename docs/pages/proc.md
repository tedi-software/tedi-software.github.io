# TEDI Integration Processors and Protocols
{: .fs-7 }



This section provides an in-depth look at the processors used in TEDI’s EAI architecture. These processors are central to handling data transformations, protocol-specific exchanges (like SFTP, HTTPS, and database interactions), and orchestrating tasks within both application-to-application (A2A) and business-to-business (B2B) integrations. They form the backbone of data flow and transaction processing, ensuring efficient and secure communication between disparate systems. Each processor is tailored to manage specific aspects of the integration process, enabling flexibility and scalability in enterprise environments.


* **Data Processing Capabilities**: The page highlights the various functions of processors, including data transformation, validation, and routing. These capabilities ensure that data is accurately processed and directed between integrated applications.

* **Processor Types**: Different types of processors are described, each tailored for specific integration tasks. This includes processors for handling specific protocols, managing data formats, and executing business logic.

* **Workflow Automation**: The processors are integral to automating workflows, allowing for the orchestration of complex integration scenarios. This automation reduces manual intervention, increases efficiency, and minimizes errors in data handling.

* **Scalability and Performance**: The architecture of TEDI’s processors is designed for scalability, enabling organizations to manage varying workloads and adapt to increasing integration demands. Performance optimization ensures that data processing is efficient and meets enterprise-level requirements.
