The TEDI Components page outlines the various integral elements that make up the TEDI software architecture. Each component is designed to facilitate enterprise application integration (EAI) by enabling seamless communication and data exchange between different systems.

Key components include:

* **Connectors**: Interfaces that link different applications and services, allowing them to communicate through various protocols.
* **Processors**: Modules that handle data transformation, validation, and routing within the integration flow.
* **Workflows**: Defined sequences of operations that automate processes and manage data exchanges between applications.
* **Security Features**: Mechanisms ensuring data integrity and secure transmission during integration.

This modular architecture allows for flexibility and scalability, making TEDI suitable for diverse integration scenarios in both application-to-application (A2A) and business-to-business (B2B) contexts.
