## Welcome to TEDI Docs
{: .fs-9 }

TEDI makes system integration simple.

TEDI is an easy-to-use, cloud-native, high-performant, low-code **integration server** also referred to as middleware. TEDI is a low-cost solution to facilitate the movement of your important business data between business applications and services (A2A & B2B) internally within your organization and externally with your trading partners.

TEDI saves engineering and development time by employing a framework of common engineering patterns that can be stitched together via workflows driven by configuration files.

TEDI has a tiny footprint. It is written in Golang and can run as a stand-alone executable or can easily be containerized.

### Enterprise System Integration
{: .fs-7 }

Many middleware SaaS or COTS offerings are large, bulky, and have a steap learning curve. TEDI takes the opposite approach.

The driving philosophy behind TEDI is to be lightweight, easy to use, with speed-of-light delivery to market by means of *development-by-configuration*.
