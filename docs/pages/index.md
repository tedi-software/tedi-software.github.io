# Welcome to TEDI Docs
{: .fs-7 }

In today’s fast-paced business world, companies rely on multiple software applications to manage their operations—everything from customer relationship management (CRM) to supply chain management (SCM) and human resources (HR). However, these applications often operate independently, leading to data silos, inefficiencies, and a lack of coordination between departments.

**TEDI** solves this problem by connecting all your systems, enabling them to communicate and share data seamlessly. TEDI acts as the bridge between various software applications, making sure that data flows smoothly and in near real-time across your entire business.

**TEDI** is the key to unlocking the full potential of your business software. By connecting systems and automating workflows, TEDI helps companies operate more efficiently, reduce costs, and make smarter, data-driven decisions. If you're looking to future-proof your organization and break down operational silos, TEDI is the solution you need.

# How Does TEDI Work?
{: .fs-6 }

TEDI software uses a combination of adapters and data transformation tools to connect different applications, even if they are built on different platforms or use different data formats. The key components include:

- **Messaging Service**: This acts as the communication layer, allowing data to be transferred between systems securely and efficiently.
  
- **Data Transformation**: TEDI ensures that data from one system can be understood by another, transforming it into a standardized format that all applications can use.

- **Process Automation**: By linking systems, TEDI can automate workflows across departments, like synchronizing inventory data with your sales platform or automating invoicing with your financial system.

- **Adapters**: These specialized connectors allow TEDI to interact with different applications, including older, legacy systems.

{: .highlight }
> TEDI is **lightweight**, **easy to use**, **configuration driven**

TEDI aims to make system integration simple. By utilizing a framework of common engineering patterns, TEDI significantly reduces development time. These patterns are easily configured into workflows, enabling low or no-code software development, which streamlines processes and optimizes productivity.

TEDI is a user-friendly, cloud-native, high-performance, low-code enterprise application integration server (EAI).

As a cost-effective solution, TEDI facilitates seamless data exchange between business applications and services, both within your organization (A2A) and with external trading partners (B2B).

TEDI has a minimal footprint and operates as a standalone executable or can be effortlessly containerized, offering flexible deployment options.
