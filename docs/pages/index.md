# Welcome to TEDI Docs
{: .fs-7 }

TEDI makes system integration simple.

TEDI is a user-friendly, cloud-native, high-performance, low-code enterprise application integration server (EAI).

As a cost-effective solution, TEDI facilitates seamless data exchange between business applications and services, both within your organization (A2A) and with external trading partners (B2B).

By utilizing a framework of common engineering patterns, TEDI significantly reduces development time. These patterns are easily configured into workflows, enabling low or no-code software development, which streamlines processes and optimizes productivity.

TEDI has a minimal footprint and operates as a standalone executable or can be effortlessly containerized, offering flexible deployment options.
